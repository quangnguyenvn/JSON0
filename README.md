# Jquill

Jquill is a Java library that converts Java Objects into their JSON format. Jquill focused on performance and was designed to handle huge tasks with minimum time. The development team used algorithms that tackle directly with byte arrays, limit the abuse of creating new objects in Java that could consume a lot of memory.

Jquill is inspired by the features of swan quills, the best quill in the world, light and elegant.
